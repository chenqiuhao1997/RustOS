# RustOS

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/chenqiuhao1997/RustOS.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/chenqiuhao1997/RustOS)

Rust port for uCore OS, supporting x86_64 and riscv32i.

## Summary

This is a project of THU Operating System (2018 Spring) && Comprehensive Experiment of Computer System (2018 Summer).

The initial goal is to write a mini OS in Rust with multi-core support. More specifically, it would start from the post of the [Writing an OS in Rust](http://os.phil-opp.com) series, then reimplement [xv6-x86_64](https://github.com/jserv/xv6-x86_64) in Rust style.

In fact, it's more complicated than we expected to write an OS starting from scratch. So by the end of OS course, we only finished rewriting [ucore_os_lab](https://github.com/chyyuu/ucore_os_lab), without multi-core support. Then as a part of [CECS project](https://github.com/riscv-and-rust-and-decaf), we ported it from x86_64 to RISCV32I, and made it work on our FPGA CPU.

## Building

### Environment

* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) toolchain at nightly-2018-09-18
* Cargo tools: [cargo-xbuild](https://github.com/rust-osdev/cargo-xbuild), [bootimage](https://github.com/rust-osdev/bootimage)
* QEMU >= 2.12.0
* [RISCV64 GNU toolchain](https://www.sifive.com/products/tools/) (for riscv32)

### How to run

```bash
rustup component add rust-src
cargo install cargo-xbuild bootimage
```

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wangrunji0408/RustOS.git
cd RustOS/kernel
rustup override set nightly-2018-09-18
make run arch=riscv32|x86_64
# For FPGA: 
# make run arch=riscv32 board=1
```
